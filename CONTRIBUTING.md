Hi, and thanks for your interest in contributing.

I'd be more than happy to accept a pull request if you want to contribute a new implementation.
So far, I only have a naive shell-script implementation, but if you can write one that uses another language, send it over.
It would be best if it could at least pass the existing tests (check with `spec/runner.rb`).
