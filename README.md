# jasmine-spec-extractor

This project collects several approaches to extracting the first 'describe' parameter in a [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) spec file.

Check the `samples/` directory for some use cases - the primary use case is to use that first parameter to open Jasmine in your OS's browser, filtering only to specs in the current file.
